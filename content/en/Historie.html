	<P>My
	flying career begins in winter 1979 one of my RC-Car friends get the
	idea to keep the control feeling or better fine tune during winter
	time by flying gliders. 
	</P>
	<P>With
	a Nimbus 3 of Carrera, 3 m wing span, I had my first minutes of
	flight. Later I used a ASW 17, even from Carrera with 2,2 m wing
	span, with this model I learned it really how to flight and how to
	alight. <BR>Due to the weight of the Nimbus the thermal performance
	was lousy. I started immediately to build a new lighter and leaner
	fuselage. The fuselage was a kernel of Styrofoam with balsa wood
	cover where I forgot to give a glass coating. I payed for it at the
	first harder alight. <BR>I learned which less effort is required to
	work with Styrofoam and balsa. Bit by bit I created different wings
	to the fuselage. But at this point in time all the wings are without
	any ailerons and I was happy to create without machines usable parts
	for my hobby.

	<P>My
	first self constructed and build glider with ailerons for slop
	soaring, WB II, 2,2 m wing span, wing profile Eppler 178, 1997 down
	cellar in Berlin. Due to limited spare time this glider get heavy
	used after I have finished my time at college in 1980 at the &quot;Gr&uuml;nen
	Heiner&quot; close to Stuttgart.

	</P>
	<P>The
	&quot;Eismann Jet&quot; was never really flight by myself, since the
	transmitter did not has mixer to be used for V tail plane rudder. As
	reaction I build an electronic mixer by myself according a plan from
	the German magazine. The equipment does not really fit into the
	small fuselage and a mechanical build mixer wasn't reliable. Some
	years later with a new transmitter with software mixer I could
	flight this plane. A friend who was present ask me to sell this
	plane to him.

	<P>One
	of my friends, who learned me most of my flight technique was a real
	good acro pilot. I was immediate infected by him. All my glider
	constructions has this type of background, I started the last
	complete self construction in summer 1980.

	<P>1983-84
	Competitor, a Quabeck construction with 3,4 m wing span, I bought
	the fuselage from Gewalt Modellbau in Reutlingen and build the wing
	by myself (Styrofoam kernel covered with Koto veneer). The first
	time all servos are placed within the wings. The wing profile cross
	over from root with NACA 4415 to the tip with Worthmann FX-125,
	inconvenient, isn't it. I used this model more than 20 years,
	afterworlds I overtook it to a colleague, he had only smaller hand
	launch gliders up to this time.

	<P>1985-86,
	DG 200 Acroracer build with a fuselage from Gewalt Modellbau with 3
	m wing span and a HQ 2,5 as profile. For the wings I realized
	attachable 30 cm wing tips. With tips attached the wing span
	increased to 3,6 m. together with the flapperons, ailerons and air
	brake there where 3 servos build within the wing. To dejam
	electronic noise from the receiver I used operational amplifier. Due
	to a wrong polarity on an capacitor and a following short cut the
	model got lost after a few flights. 
	</P>
	<P>For
	the moment I had enough glider models, animate by magazines I was
	interested by flying with electro motors. So I build some motor
	driver and battery charger. But at this point in time the motors had
	to less power, and the batteries to less capacity. For this reasons
	it makes no sense to me to have this type of engines used for
	gliders. So I build a sports model and used it for testing.

	Elliptic E, more or less copied from an American magazine. A sports
	model with HQ 1.5 as profile for the wings with end to end
	flapperons. Under the line this model had very good gliding
	capability. <BR>The construction plan was drawn in not counted lunch
	breaks with a CADDAM system (further education).
	</P>
	<P>Flying
	with electro power was not sufficient at this time and the
	continuous charging and discharging of the batteries caused me to
	stop this activity soon.

	transmitter frequency.
