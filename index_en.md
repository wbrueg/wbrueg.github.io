# Introduction




Since this is a private site,
only my private interests are dealt with here!



Glider model making - experiencing motorless flight,
does not take up a particularly large amount of time,
anyhow I have been particularly interested in this for more than 40 years.


So anyone who has nothing to do with aerodynamics, model building 
or model soaring will not get particularly happy here.
